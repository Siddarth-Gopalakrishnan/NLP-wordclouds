# NLP-wordclouds

In this Repo I have shared the code for doing NLP analysis for reviews. Here I have done Pre-processing tasks for text data which includes cleaning the text(removing punctuations, white spaces, colons etc..,) ,tokenisation, stopwords removal, stemming & lemmatization.

After preprocessing we'll be moving to generate ngrams and word cloud for reviews to understand the sentiment of particular product/service.

For Data Collection you can use Beautiful Soup, Selnium(if u wish for automation) and also free tools like Octoparse ( for limited data on free trial upto 10k Records)
